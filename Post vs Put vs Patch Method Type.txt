Use POST for creating a new resource.
Use PUT for updating an existing resource or creating a new one with a specific identifier.
Use PATCH for applying partial updates to an existing resource.
When designing RESTful APIs, it's essential to follow the principles of idempotence and use the appropriate HTTP methods based on the intended operation. 
The choice between PUT and PATCH depends on whether you are updating the entire resource or just a part of it.
