Why post method is not idempotent?

Creation of Resources: In RESTful APIs, POST is commonly used for creating new resources.
Subsequent POST requests with the same data may create new resources each time, leading to different results.

While it's a convention to use POST for non-idempotent operations, developers should be
aware that it's the responsibility of the application to manage and handle idempotency if needed.

Note:
    1. In the context of HTTP methods, an idempotent method is one that produces the same result regardless of how many times it is executed.
    2. The HTTP methods that are considered idempotent are GET, HEAD, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.
