what is cycle dependency in spring boot and how to remove that?

A circular or cyclic dependency in Spring occurs when two or more beans depend on each other directly or indirectly.
This can create a problem during the bean instantiation process because Spring needs to create and initialize beans in a
specific order to satisfy their dependencies. When there's a circular dependency, Spring might not be able to determine
the order of bean creation, leading to an error.

Here's an example of a circular dependency:

java
Copy code
public class A {
    private B b;

    @Autowired
    public A(B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}

public class B {
    private A a;

    @Autowired
    public B(A a) {
        this.a = a;
    }
}
In this example, class A depends on class B, and class B depends on class A, creating a circular dependency.

To resolve circular dependencies in Spring, you can use one of the following approaches:

Setter Injection:

Instead of using constructor injection, use setter injection for one of the dependencies.
Modify one of the classes to use setter injection for its dependency, breaking the circular reference during construction.
java
Copy code
public class A {
    private B b;

    @Autowired
    public void setB(B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}

public class B {
    private A a;

    @Autowired
    public B(A a) {
        this.a = a;
    }
}
Use @Lazy Annotation:

Use the @Lazy annotation to delay the injection of one of the dependencies until it's actually needed.
java
Copy code
public class A {
    private B b;

    @Autowired
    public A(@Lazy B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}

public class B {
    private A a;

    @Autowired
    public B(A a) {
        this.a = a;
    }
}
Interface-Based Proxies:

Introduce an interface for one of the classes and use an interface-based proxy to break the circular dependency.
java
Copy code
public interface AInterface {
    // define methods
}

public class A implements AInterface {
    private B b;

    @Autowired
    public A(B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}

public class B {
    private AInterface a;

    @Autowired
    public B(AInterface a) {
        this.a = a;
    }
}
