GOF Singleton Design Pattern:-
              If a class in Singleton, then only one object will be created in JVM, or when we run our application in JVM, 1 obj will be created.

Singleton bean scope:-
            If we mark a singleton bean, then per ApplicationContext a bean will be created.

For Example: Let's say, we have 2 xml file i.e. used to scan the package for bean creation.

ApplicationContext appContext1 =  new ClassPathXMLApplicationContext("beans1.xml");
Student stu1 = appContext1.getBean("student", Student.class);
Student stu2 = appContext1.getBean("student", Student.class);
//Both stu1 and stu2 will have same object

ApplicationContext appContext2 =  new ClassPathXMLApplicationContext("beans2.xml");
Student stu3 = appContext2.getBean("student", Student.class);
Student stu4 = appContext2.getBean("student", Student.class);
//Both stu3 and stu4 will have same object

//But stu1 and stu3 will have different object, coz both bean is in the different application context.

@Component
@Scope(value = ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
public class Student{

}
