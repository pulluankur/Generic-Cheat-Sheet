1. Java will provide default constructor, if and only if you are not providing any constructor in the class.

Java is Pass by value.

Deep vs shallow copy
    1. Shallow copy: only copies the reference of the object, not the actual object.
    2. Deep copy: creates a new object and copies all the values from the original object to the new object.

Type of GC's:---
    Anyone GC can be used by Command Line Argument in Java.
    1. Serial GC
    2. Parallel GC (Java8 default GC)
    3. Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) GC
    5. G1 GC
    6. Z GC

How many ways to create a thread in Java?
    1. By extending Thread class
    2. By implementing Runnable interface
    3. By using Executor framework (SingleThreadExecutor, FixedThreadPool, CachedThreadPool, ScheduledThreadPool)
    4. By using CompletableFuture (We donâ€™t need to use the ExecutorService explicitly. The CompletableFuture internally
                                   uses ForkJoinPool to handle the task asynchronously. Thus, it makes our code a lot
                                   cleaner.)
    Executor Example:
    ```java
        ExecutorService threadpool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(); //you don't need to create the thread pool's for completable future
        Future<Long> futureTask = threadpool.submit(() -> factorial(number));
        while (!futureTask.isDone()) {
        System.out.println("FutureTask is not finished yet...");
        }
        long result = futureTask.get(); //Blocking Code
    ```

    5. By using CompletableFuture (Java 8 feature)
    CompletableFuture Example:
    ```java
        CompletableFuture<Long> completableFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() ->
        factorial(number));

        long result = completableFuture.get(); //Blocking Code
    ```
